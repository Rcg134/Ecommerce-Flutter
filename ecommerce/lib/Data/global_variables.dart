        'A family of 64-bit x86 CPUs with up to 18 cores from Intel. Introduced in 2017, the Core i9 became the top model in the Core "i" series. Also part of the Intel Core X-series brand, the first i9 CPU (7900x) is based on 14 nm process technology and the Skylake-X microarchitecture. It features four channels of DDR4 RAM and 44 lanes of PCI Express (compared with 28 in the i7). Designed for high-performance computing and gaming, the 3.3 GHz i9 chip can be overclocked to 4.5 GHz.

        'Its processor clock speed ranges from 1.70 GHz to up to 3.90 GHz, with cache memory from 4 to 12 MB. Intel Corei7 thermal design power (TDP) range goes from 130 watts TDP to as low as 15 watts TDP. Similar to some other Corei series processors, the Intel Corei7 supports error correction code (ECC) memory, Intel Platform Protection Security and Intel OS Guards. These features provide embedded security abilities for protecting BIOS, enabling secure boot and protection against attacks.',

        'The Core i5 processor is available in multiple speeds, ranging from 1.90 GHz up to 3.80 GHz, and it features 3 MB, 4 MB or 6 MB of cache. It utilizes either the LGA (land grid array) 1150 or LGA 1155 socket on a motherboard. Core i5 processors are often found as quad-core, having four cores. However, a select few high-end Core i5 processors feature six cores.',

        'It consists of two cores, but supports four different threads simultaneously. The clock speed of a Corei3 ranges from 1.70 GHz to 3.4 GHz. Intel has launched several generations of Corei3 processors, each improving on the capabilities and performance of the former. The latest versions have higher processor caches with less power consumption, ranging from 73 W thermal design power (TDP) to as low as 15 TDP. Moreover, some of the latest generations of the Intel Corei3 support error correction code (ECC) memory, Intel Platform Protection Security and Intel OS Guards, an embedded security feature for protecting BIOS, enabling secure boot and prevention against attacks.',
